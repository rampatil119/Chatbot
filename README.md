# Chatbot Project

This is a chatbot application powered by **Google Generative AI**. It allows users to interact with an AI model by entering messages, receiving AI-generated responses, and providing the ability to edit their own messages. The bot utilizes a model called "gemini-1.5-flash" to generate responses.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can type their messages in the input field and interact with the AI.
- **AI Responses**: The AI generates responses based on the userâ€™s input.
- **Edit User Messages**: Users can edit their own messages after they have been sent.
- **Simple UI**: The interface consists of a message display area, an input field, and a button to trigger the chatbot's response.
